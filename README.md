Experimental Hybrid ML Trading Signal Prototype
This repository contains an experimental algorithmic trading system that integrates hybrid machine learning models (CNN-LSTM and XGBoost) with technical indicators to generate market signals across multiple forex pairs and timeframes. The pipeline integrates TwelveData API feeds with real-time technical analysis (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.), processes sequential data through a hybrid deep learning architecture, and logs predictions with probabilistic confidence scores to a PostgreSQL database via FastAPI. While operational, this remains an experimental prototype undergoing continuous refinement to improve predictive accuracy. Current implementation focuses on model integration and backtesting infrastructure rather than production readiness, with several known limitations in feature engineering and risk management components. The system's experimental nature means frequent architectural changes and undocumented breaking modifications are expected as development prioritizes research over stability.
